# Random Quiz

This app makes use of the MVP pattern, dependency injection and testing.

This app was created for the purpose of demostrating some best practices in Android develpment and develpment in general.

There are a lot of good examples out there using best practices, most of them are simple apps that set a list. Typically todo apps are the goto app to create for an example, I thought I'd create something slighty different as an example.
